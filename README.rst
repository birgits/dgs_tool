Installation
============

First of all you need a working Python 3 environment. On Windows it is easiest to use `anaconda`_.   

.. _anaconda:
  https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

Next clone or download the repository to your local file system and install it through:

.. code::

    pip install -e path/to/dgs_tool

This tool is designed for Python 3 and tested on Python >= 3.6.

We highly recommend to use virtual environments. Please see the
`installation page`_ of the oemof documentation for complete
instructions on how to install python and a virtual environment on your
operating system.
